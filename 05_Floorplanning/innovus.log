**WARN: (IMPFP-4026):	Adjusting core to 'Left' to 124.880000 due to track/row misalignment. To force the value, specify the -noSnapToGrid option or use fpiSetSnapRule command to specify the die/core to different grid.
**WARN: (IMPFP-4026):	Adjusting core to 'Bottom' to 124.880000 due to track/row misalignment. To force the value, specify the -noSnapToGrid option or use fpiSetSnapRule command to specify the die/core to different grid.

**WARN: (IMPFP-3961):	The techSite 'CO_MSTR_c' has no related standard cells in the LEF/OA library. The calculations for this site type cannot be made unless standard cell models of this type exist in the LEF/OA library. Ignore this warning if the SITE is not used by the library. Alternatively, remove the SITE definition for the LEF/OA library to avoid this message.
Type 'man IMPFP-3961' for more detail.
