RC Extraction called in multi-corner(2) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6166):	Capacitance table file(s) without the EXTENDED section is being used for RC extraction. This is not recommended because it results in lower accuracy for clock nets in preRoute extraction and for all nets in postRoute extraction using -effortLevel low. Regenerate capacitance table file(s) using the generateCapTbl command.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
